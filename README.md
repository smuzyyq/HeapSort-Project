# HeapSort Algorithm Implementation

## Description
This project implements the **HeapSort** algorithm in Java. HeapSort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by converting the input array into a **heap** data structure and then extracting the largest (or smallest) element iteratively to produce a sorted array.

## Key Features
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in the worst, best, and average cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place sorting).
- **Stability**: Not stable.
- **Uses bottom-up heapify** for optimal performance.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java/HeapSort.java` - Contains the implementation of the HeapSort algorithm.
- `src/test/java/HeapSortTest.java` - Contains unit tests for verifying the correctness of the algorithm.
- `pom.xml` - Maven build file to manage dependencies and project configuration.
